> CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build,
> test and package software. CMake is used to control the software compilation
> process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files,
> and generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler
> environment of your choice. The suite of CMake tools were created by Kitware
> in response to the need for a powerful, cross-platform build environment for
> open-source projects such as ITK and VTK.

This Dev Container Feature will install CMake using the official installer `.sh`
script into the `/usr/local` folder. This should place it on your `$PATH` no
problem! üöÄ It also installs the [CMake VS Code extension].
